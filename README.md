Attach a video file and use naturual language to describe what you want to do to it.

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Install Chrome Dev</strong>: Ensure you have version 127. [Download Chrome Dev](https://google.com/chrome/dev/).</li>
    <li>Check that youâ€™re on 127.0.6512.0 or above</li>
    <li>Enable two flags:
      <ul>
        <li>chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model - BypassPerfRequirement</li>
        <li>chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano - Enabled</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Relaunch Chrome</li>
    <li>Navigate to chrome://components</li>
    <li>Check that Optimization Guide On Device Model is downloading or force download if not
    Might take a few minutes for this component to even appear</li>
    <li>Open dev tools and type <code>(await ai.languageModel.capabilities()).available</code>, should return "readily" when all good</li>
  </ol>

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How does it work

Using the [Prompt API](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api) we take in natural language queries and map that to the closest match in a `Map` that holds the actual ffmpeg command e.g.

E.g "Turn into gif" -> Gemini Nano -> "Convert video to GIF"

Looking up that string it returns:

```js
{
  "Change video resolution": [
    "-i",
    "{{input}}",
    "-vf",
    "scale=1280:720",
    "-y",
    "{{output}}",
  ],
}
```

This query then interpolates the input and output that is stored when you attach a file to get the actual file names to pass into [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm).

## Limitations

Right now this tool will do simple operations, you can see exactly what it can do the [AI class](https://github.com/ryanseddon/FFprompt/blob/3d72a627171239db7c6de901d05c1b33e4baf5d3/src/lib/AI.ts#L20-L99).

Working on large video files isn't terribly fast (it's actually pretty slow), there is a multi threaded version of ffmpeg.wasm and it can also support WORKERFS mounting over the default MEMFS but I haven't explored that yet.
